# odu-cs250
Projects for my CS250 course - Fall 2017

All projects in this directory is made using C++

This repository includes all the project and assignments created in my CS250 course during my Sophomore Year of College at Old Dominion University. 
So far added:

final_jjennin – This is my final project that is a hospital management system, allows you to manage appointments, slots, doctors, patients, patient records, and read from text files to allow for mass changes. 

In order to compile and run these projects, you need to download the directory and then you can use the make file. Running ‘make’ while in the directory, it should create an executive file (you may need to chmod +x the file).
