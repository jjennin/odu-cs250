Dear Mom,

I just wanted to let you know that I am alive and well. Jane is
well also. I'm glad they were able to relocate us. My
only complaint is that I wish they could have found someplace
more exciting than Kansas for us to live in! If you really need
to contact us, you can do so by telephone. The number is
(757) 555-0478, but don't tell anyone.

Love,
the new John Smith
